When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. hared drive failure. 2. more people on the same project
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
large commits and maybe you were working on something which then gets interupted.
